        <h2>Ingredients you'll need:</h2>
   
        <ol>
            <li>
                 <ul>pieces of bread</ul> 
                 <ul>2 pats of butter</ul>
                 <ul>1 slice of monterey jack cheese</ul>
                 <ul>1 slice of aged cheddar cheese</ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
         <h3>Process:</h3>  

           <ol>
            <li>Fetch yourself a fat-bottom skillet</li> 
             
            <li>Heat the skillet over medium heat</li>

            <li>Butter one side of each slice of bread</li>
            
            <li>Place one slice of the buttered bread, buttered side down, into the skillet</li>
            
            <li>Quickly place each slice of cheese on the bread, being sure to cover the entire surface area</li>
            
            <li>Place the other slice of bread, butter side up, on top of the cheese</li>
            
            <li>Wait approximately 1 to 2 minutes (or till the bread touching the skillet is a golden brown)</li>
            
            <li>Flip the sandwich over with some awesome pizazz and cook the other side till golden brown (approximately 1 to 2 minutes)</li>

            <li>Eat with ketchup, or just enjoy the plain crispy goodness of your grilled cheese</li>
           </ol> 
           <h4>Note:</h4>
           <p> Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The result will be much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.
              Remember, Shaun says "Grilled cheese sandwiches are a staple of the North American diet!".</p>
